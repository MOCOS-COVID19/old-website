                        <p>In the current phase, the epidemic is characterized by a constant number of new infections in a fixed unit of time (e.g. during the week) - this is the so-called endemic state. The goal of all should be to bring the epidemic to an end as soon as possible by reducing the opportunities for new infections. This is not only possible, but also much more cost-effective economically and socially than prolonging the duration of the threat. </p>

                        <p>Until September 22, 2020, the 7-day average of daily new cases in Poland may increase to around 800 from the current level of 725.</p>

					<h3>An upward trend</h3>
					
					<p>Since the first loosening of the restrictions announced at the end of April, the mobility of Poles has consistently increased from the level of -60% compared to the reference value, i.e. the level of mobility observed from the beginning of the year to mid-March, and has remained at the level of + 70-80% of the value since mid-July<a href="https://covid19.apple.com/mobility" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. At the same time, from mid-July to approx. August 10, we observed a strong increase in the daily increase in new cases, which significantly slowed down over the past two weeks. </p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>

                    <p>The epidemic in Poland is growing again, and outbreaks of infections appear like mushrooms after rain. A month ago we reported that the epidemic in Poland has gone to extinction, this trend has been reversed. Now the country is again at the stage of steady growth of new infections. The largest share in the number of newly diagnosed cases is in Śląskie, Mazowieckie and Łódzkie Voivodeships. </p>
                    <p>In Lower Silesia, the growth of new infections is decreasing with each day, but we are far from a lack of new infections.</p>
                    <p>The epidemic in Wrocław is also slowly dying out, but we have only 10% chance to finish it before the new school year. For Poland and Lower Silesia the forecasts do not give even such small chances for the end of the epidemic before September.</p>
                    <p>Home and workplace contacts are the main sources of infections, and the proportion of workplace infections is likely to increase in the future.</p>
                    <p>Car mobility among the population - both in Poland and Lower Silesia or Wrocław itself - has reached the state before the epidemic. We move as often as we do, and we come into contact with other people, which is a natural mechanism of virus reproduction.</p>
                    <p>If the record numbers of new infections reported in recent days are not limited to the households of mine workers and other workplaces that are outbreaks of infections, the more pessimistic variants of our forecast for the development of the epidemic must be taken seriously.</p>

Only for a small assumed effectiveness of contact tracing, the epidemic may be on the critical line where the epidemic remains on a similar level.

                    <small>21.04.2020</small>
                    <p>The simulations indicate that the opening of MSU-IIT can lead to a super-spreading event, if not combined with strict hygiene and social distancing measures, which reduce the number of secondary infections. It is too expect that the contact rate for students at MSU-IIT is higher than in the rest of the population due to teaching in classrooms and laboratories. Even an augmented immunity does not prevent from a massive outbreak. The more the immunity is built up the less intensive is the increased disease spread from MSU-IIT into the city. We strongly suggest to monitor the progression of COVID-19 during the weakening of the lockdown after April 30, 2020 before opening MSU-IIT. In addition we recommend to take strong social distancing and hygiene measures to milder the disease spread.

                    <small>5.04.2020</small>
                    <p>In different media there is an ongoing debate about weakening the social distancing measures. In this techreport we show for the example of the city of Iligan, Philippines, that, in order not to exceed the capacity of the health system, it it crucial to reduce the outer household contacts. Moreover a mitigation strategy is not recommendable, since the social distancing can not be tuned fine enough. We also simulate how massive testing combined with household contacts can be used in addition to social distancing measures.

                        <small>Number of infected depending on the level of detection of asymptomatic cases (q) and level of contact restriction.</small>
                        <p>If the contacts of 15-18 year olds in the school are reduced to 18 percent, about 7800 Berliners will be infected within 300 days, and 156 will die in total. To subtract from this number, there are about 5500 infected and 128 dead, which would also happen without the schools closing. If, however, in this age range, i.e. 8 instead of 10 contacts, contacts are reduced to 80 percent, almost thirty times more Berliners, about 200,000, will be infected and about 3,000 people will die. Even half the contacts of high school students (48 percent) will still lead to about 2700 dead and 185,000 infected people. The opening of schools and public life is in our opinion premature at this stage.

                        <p>Microsimulations for Rhineland-Palatinate on the basis of our model give strong indications that the opening of schools together with relaxed contact reduction can only be safely carried out with very high resistance. The opening of schools for individual classes is possible with strong hygiene and social distance if the rest of the population also follows a very strong contact reduction and a significant immunization is ensured. Opening schools and public life is in our opinion premature at this stage.
